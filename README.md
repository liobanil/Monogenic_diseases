Abstract
Monogenic diseases consist of a single or multiple mutation in a single gene. This kind of affections are present in all human populations, the phenotype varies  according to penetrance and environmental factors making them hard to identify and treat in some cases. Thus a fine understanding of the affected sequence and the molecular mechanisms is necessary for development of medical approaches. In this project we attempt to identify how many of these diseases affect the coding sequence (CDS) of its gene, and the rest of mutations which do not fall into a CDS were also mapped to what molecule (e. g. lncRNAs) they affected. We found that mutations of monogenic diseases that fell in CDS are less than 1%, and lncRNAs seems to represent a more versatile and present modifications in diseases, providing a role not just directly into expression but also in its regulation.
